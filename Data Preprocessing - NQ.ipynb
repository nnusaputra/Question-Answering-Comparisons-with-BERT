      The First Transcontinental Railroad ( also called the Great Transcontinental Railroad , known originally as the `` Pacific Railroad '' and later as the `` Overland Route '' ) was a 1,912 - mile ( 3,077 km ) continuous railroad line constructed between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Omaha , Nebraska / Council Bluffs , Iowa with the Pacific coast at the Oakland Long Wharf on San Francisco Bay . The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive US land grants . Construction was financed by both state and US government subsidy bonds as well as by company issued mortgage bonds . The Western Pacific Railroad Company built 132 mi ( 212 km ) of track from Oakland / Alameda to Sacramento , California . The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California ( CPRR ) constructed 690 mi ( 1,110 km ) eastward from Sacramento to Promontory Summit , Utah Territory ( U.T. ) . The Union Pacific built 1,085 mi ( 1,746 km ) from the road 's eastern terminus at Council Bluffs near Omaha , Nebraska westward to Promontory Summit .   The railroad opened for through traffic on May 10 , 1869 when CPRR President Leland Stanford ceremonially drove the gold `` Last Spike '' ( later often referred to as the `` Golden Spike '' ) with a silver hammer at Promontory Summit . The coast - to - coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West . It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast - to - coast considerably quicker and less expensive .   Paddle steamers linked Sacramento to the cities and their harbor facilities in the San Francisco Bay until 1869 , when the CPRR completed and opened the WP grade ( which the CPRR had acquired control of in 1867 -- 68 ) to Alameda and Oakland .   The first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad 's original western terminus at the Alameda Mole on September 6 , 1869 where they transferred to the steamer Alameda for transport across the Bay to San Francisco . The road 's rail terminus was moved two months later to the Oakland Long Wharf about a mile to the north . Service between San Francisco and Oakland Pier continued to be provided by ferry .   The CPRR eventually purchased 53 miles ( 85 km ) of UPRR - built grade from Promontory Summit ( MP 828 ) to Ogden , U.T. ( MP 881 ) , which became the interchange point between trains of the two roads . The transcontinental line was popularly known as the Overland Route after the principal passenger rail service that operated over the length of the line until 1962 .   Building a railroad line that connected the United States coast - to - coast was advocated in 1832 when Dr. Hartwell Carver published an article in the New York Courier & Enquirer advocating building a transcontinental railroad from Lake Michigan to Oregon . In 1847 he submitted to the U.S. Congress a `` Proposal for a Charter to Build a Railroad from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean '' , seeking a congressional charter to support his idea .   Congress agreed to support the idea . Under the direction of the Department of War , the Pacific Railroad Surveys were conducted from 1853 through 1855 . These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes . A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the American West , covering at least 400,000 sq mi ( 1,000,000 km ) . It included the region 's natural history and illustrations of reptiles , amphibians , birds , and mammals .   The report failed however to include detailed topographic maps of potential routes needed to estimate the feasibility , cost and select the best route . The survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the Gila River boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert , through the future territories of Arizona and New Mexico . This in part motivated the United States to complete the Gadsden Purchase .   In 1856 the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph of the US House of Representatives published a report recommending support for a proposed Pacific railroad bill :   The necessity that now exists for constructing lines of railroad and telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of this continent is no longer a question for argument ; it is conceded by every one . In order to maintain our present position on the Pacific , we must have some more speedy and direct means of intercourse than is at present afforded by the route through the possessions of a foreign power .   The U.S. Congress was strongly divided on where the eastern terminus of the railroad should be -- in a southern or northern city . Three routes were considered :   Once the central route was chosen , it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento . But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus . Three locations along 250 miles ( 400 km ) of Missouri River were considered :   Council Bluffs had several advantages : It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri ; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming ; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement . Durant had hired the future president Abraham Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri . Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus , and he relied on Durant 's counsel . Durant advocated for Omaha , and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska .   One of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was Asa Whitney . He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California , paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route . Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians , printed maps and pamphlets , and submitted several proposals to Congress , all at his own expense . In June 1845 , he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility .   Legislation to begin construction of the Pacific Railroad ( called the Memorial of Asa Whitney ) was first introduced to Congress by Representative Zadock Pratt . Congress did not immediately act on Whitney 's proposal .   Theodore Judah was a fervent supporter of the central route railroad . He lobbied vigorously in favor of the project and undertook the survey of the route through the rugged Sierra Nevada , one of the chief obstacles of the project .   In 1852 , Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed Sacramento Valley Railroad , the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River . Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville , California were depleted , Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East .   In 1856 , Judah wrote a 13,000 - word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries , congressmen and other influential people . In September 1859 , Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention , which indeed approved his plan to survey , finance and engineer the road . Judah returned to Washington in December 1859 . He had a lobbying office in the United States Capitol , received an audience with President James Buchanan , and represented the Convention before Congress .   Judah returned to California in 1860 . He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad . In mid-1860 , local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road , which he realized would also suit a railroad . He described his discovery in a letter to Judah . Together , they formed an association to solicit subscriptions from local merchants and businessmen to support their proposed railroad .   From January or February 1861 until July , Judah and Strong led a 10 - person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and Emigrant Gap , over Donner Pass , and south to Truckee . They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad , although it still needed a lot of work .   Four northern California businessmen formed the Central Pacific Railroad : Leland Stanford , ( 1824 -- 1893 ) , President ; Collis Potter Huntington , ( 1821 -- 1900 ) , Vice President ; Mark Hopkins , ( 1813 -- 1878 ) , Treasurer ; Charles Crocker , ( 1822 -- 1888 ) , Construction Supervisor . All became substantially wealthy from their association with the railroad .   Former ophthalmologist Dr. Thomas Clark `` Doc '' Durant was nominally only a vice president of Union Pacific , so he installed a series of respected men like John Adams Dix as president of the railroad . Durant and its financing arrangements were , unlike those of the CPRR , mired in controversy and scandals .   In February 1860 , Iowa Representative Samuel Curtis introduced a bill to fund the railroad . It passed the House but died when it could not be reconciled with the Senate version due to opposition from southern states who wanted a southern route near the 42nd parallel . Curtis tried and failed again in 1861 . After the southern states seceded from the Union , the House of Representatives approved the bill on May 6 , 1862 , and the Senate on June 20 . Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 into law on July 1 . It authorized creation of two companies , the Central Pacific in the west and the Union Pacific in the mid-west , to build the railroad . The legislation called for building and operating a new railroad from the Missouri River at Council Bluffs , Iowa , west to Sacramento , California , and on to San Francisco Bay . A second law to supplement the first was passed in 1864 .   To finance the project , the act authorized the federal government to issue 30 - year U.S. government bonds ( at 6 % interest ) . The railroad companies were paid $16,000 / mile ( approximately $436,000 today ) for track laid on a level grade , $32,000 / mile ( about $872,000 today ) for track laid in foothills , and $48,000 / mile ( or about $1,307,000 today ) for track laid in mountains . The two railroad companies sold similar amounts of company - backed bonds and stock .   While the federal legislation for the Union Pacific required that no partner was to own more than 10 percent of the stock , the UP had problems selling its stock . One of the few subscribers was Mormon leader Brigham Young , who also supplied crews for building much of the railroad through Utah . Durant enticed other investors by offering to front money for the stock they purchased in their names . This scheme enabled Durant to control about half of the railroad stock . The initial construction of UP grade traversed land owned by Durant . Durant 's railroad was paid by the mile , and to further inflate its profits , the UP built oxbows of unneeded track , and by July 4 , 1865 , it had only reached 40 miles ( 64 km ) from Omaha after 21⁄2 years of construction .   Durant manipulated market prices on his stocks by spreading rumors about which railroads he had an interest in were being considered for connection with the Union Pacific . First he touted rumors that his fledgling M&M Railroad had a deal in the works , while secretly buying stock in the depressed Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad . Then he circulated rumors that the CR&M had plans to connect to the Union Pacific , at which point he began buying back the M&M stock at depressed prices . It 's estimated his scams produced over $5 million in profits for him and his cohorts .   Collis Huntington , a Sacramento hardware merchant , heard Judah 's presentation about the railroad at the St. Charles Hotel in November 1860 . He invited Judah to his office to hear his proposal in detail . Huntington persuaded Judah to accept financing from himself and four others : Mark Hopkins , his business partner ; James Bailey , a jeweler ; Leland Stanford , a grocer ; and Charles Crocker , a dry - goods merchant . They initially invested $1,500 each and formed a board of directors . These investors became known as The Big Four , and their railroad was called the Central Pacific Railroad . Each eventually made millions of dollars from their investments and control of the Central Pacific Railroad .   Before major construction could begin , Judah traveled back to New York City to raise funds to buy out The Big Four . However , shortly after arriving in New York , Judah died on November 2 , 1863 , of yellow fever that he had contracted while traveling over the Panama Railroad 's transit of the Isthmus of Panama . The CPRR Engineering Department was taken over by his successor Samuel S. Montegue , as well as Canadian trained Chief Assistant Engineer ( later Acting Chief Engineer ) Lewis Metzler Clement who also became Superintendent of Track .   To allow the companies to raise additional capital , Congress granted the railroads a 400 - foot ( 120 m ) right - of - way corridor , lands for additional facilities like sidings and maintenance yards . They were also granted alternate sections of government - owned lands -- 6,400 acres ( 2,600 ha ) per mile ( 1.6 km ) -- for 10 miles ( 16 km ) on both sides of the track , forming a checkerboard pattern . The railroad companies were given the odd - numbered sections while the federal government retained the even - numbered sections . The exception was in cities , at rivers , or on non-government property . The railroads sold bonds based on the value of the lands , and in areas with good land like the Sacramento Valley and Nebraska sold the land to settlers , contributing to a rapid settlement of the West . The total area of the land grants to the Union Pacific and Central Pacific was larger than the area of the state of Texas : federal government land grants totaled about 203,128,500 square miles , and state government land grants totaled about 76,565,000 square miles .   It was far from a given that the railroads operating in the thinly - settled west would make enough money to repay their construction and operation . If the railroad companies failed to sell the land granted them within three years , they were required to sell it at prevailing government price for homesteads : $1.25 per 1 acre ( 0.40 ha ) . If they failed to repay the bonds , all remaining railroad property , including trains and tracks , would revert to the U.S. government . To encourage settlement in the west , Congress ( 1861 -- 1863 ) passed the Homestead Acts which granted an applicant 160 acres ( 65 ha ) of land with the requirement that the applicant improve the land . This incentive encouraged thousands of settlers to move west .   The federal legislation lacked adequate oversight and accountability . The two companies took advantage of these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves . Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government , the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months , possibly years . They determined to make a profit on the construction itself . Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project , and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures . This self - dealing allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies . In the west , the four men heading the Central Pacific chose a simple name for their company , the `` Contract and Finance Company . '' In the east , the Union Pacific selected a foreign name , calling their construction firm `` Crédit Mobilier of America . '' The latter company was later implicated in a far - reaching scandal , described later .   Many of the engineers and surveyors who were hired by the Union Pacific had been employed during the American Civil War to repair and operate the over 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of railroad line the U.S. Military Railroad controlled by the end of the war . The UP also utilized their experience repairing and building truss bridges during the war . Most of the semi-skilled workers on the Union Pacific were recruited from the many soldiers discharged from the Union and Confederate armies along with emigrant Irishmen .   After 1864 , the Central Pacific Railroad received the same Federal financial incentives as the Union Pacific Railroad , along with some construction bonds granted by the state of California and the city of San Francisco . The Central Pacific hired some Canadian and British engineers and surveyors with extensive experience building railroads , but it had a difficult time finding semi-skilled labor . Most Caucasians in California preferred to work in the mines or agriculture . The railroad experimented by hiring local emigrant Chinese as manual laborers , many of whom were escaping the poverty and terrors of the Taiping Rebellion in the Guangdong province in China . When they proved themselves as workers , the CPRR from that point forward preferred to hire Chinese , and even set up recruiting efforts in Canton . Despite their small stature and lack of experience , the Chinese laborers were responsible for most of the heavy manual labor , since only a very limited amount of that work could be done by animals , simple machines , or black powder . The railroad also hired some black people escaping the aftermath of the American Civil War . Most of the black and white workers were paid $30 per month and given food and lodging . Most Chinese were initially paid $31 per month and provided lodging , but they preferred to cook their own meals . In 1867 the CPRR raised their wage to $35 ( equivalent to $610 in 2017 ) per month after a strike .   The Central Pacific broke ground on January 8 , 1863 . Due to the lack of transportation alternatives from the manufacturing centers on the east coast , virtually all of their tools and machinery including rails , railroad switches , railroad turntables , freight and passenger cars , and steam locomotives were transported first by train to east coast ports . They were then loaded on ships which either sailed around South America 's Cape Horn , or offloaded the cargo at the Isthmus of Panama , where it was sent across via paddle steamer and the Panama Railroad . The Panama Railroad gauge was 5 ft ( 1524 mm ) , which was incompatible with the 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 inch ( 1435mm ) gauge used by the CPRR equipment . The latter route was about twice as expensive per pound . Once the machinery and tools reached the San Francisco Bay area , they were put aboard river paddle steamers which transported them up the final 130 miles ( 210 km ) of the Sacramento River to the new state capital in Sacramento . Many of these steam engines , railroad cars , and other machinery were shipped dismantled and had to be reassembled . Wooden timbers for railroad ties , trestles , bridges , firewood , and telegraph poles were harvested in California and transported to the project site .   The Union Pacific Railroad did not start construction for another 18 months until July 1865 . They were delayed by difficulties obtaining financial backing and the unavailability of workers and materials due to the Civil War . Their start point in the new city of Omaha , Nebraska was not yet connected via railroad to Council Bluffs , Iowa . Equipment needed to begin work was initially delivered to Omaha and Council Bluffs by paddle steamers on the Missouri River . The Union Pacific was so slow in beginning construction during 1865 that they sold two of the four steam locomotives they had purchased .   After the U.S. Civil War ended on June 22 , 1865 , the Union Pacific still competed for railroad supplies with companies who were building or repairing railroads in the south , and prices rose .   At that time in the United States , there were two primary standards for track gauge , as defined by the distance between the two rails . In England , the standard gauge was 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 inch ( 1.435 m ) , and this had been adopted by the majority of northern railways . But much of the south had adopted a 5 - foot gauge . Transferring railway cars across a break of gauge required changing out the wheel trucks . Alternatively , cargo was offloaded and reloaded , a time - consuming effort that delayed cargo shipments . For the transcontinental railroad , the builders adopted the English standard , what is now called standard gauge .   The Bessemer process and open hearth furnace steel - making were in use by 1865 , but the advantages of steel rails which lasted much longer than iron rails had not yet been demonstrated . The rails used initially in building the rail way were nearly all made of iron of a flat - bottomed modified I - beam profile weighing 56 pounds ( 25 kg ) per 1 yard ( 0.91 m ) or 66 pounds ( 30 kg ) per 1 yard ( 0.91 m ) . The railroad companies were intent on completing the project as rapidly as possible at a minimum cost . Within a few years , nearly all railroads converted to steel rails .   Time was not standardized across the United States and Canada until November 18 , 1883 . In 1865 , each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors . To communicate easily up and down the line , the railroads built telegraph lines alongside the railroad . These lines eventually superseded the original First Transcontinental Telegraph which followed much of the Mormon Trail up the North Platte River and across the very thinly populated Central Nevada Route through central Utah and Nevada . The telegraph lines along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain . Many of the original telegraph lines were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad telegraph lines .   The Union Pacific 's 1,087 miles ( 1,749 km ) of track started at MP 0.0 in Council Bluffs , Iowa , on the eastern side of the Missouri River . Omaha was chosen by President Abraham Lincoln as the location of its Transfer Depot where up to seven railroads could transfer mail and other goods to Union Pacific trains bound for the west .   Trains were initially transported across the Missouri River by ferry before they could access the western tracks beginning in Omaha , Nebraska Territory . The river froze in the winter , and the ferries were replaced by sleighs . A bridge was not built until 1872 , when the 2,750 - foot - long ( 840 m ) Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge was completed .   After the rail line 's initial climb through the Missouri River bluffs west of Omaha and out of the Missouri River Valley , the route bridged the Elkhorn River and then crossed over the new 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) Loup River bridge as it followed the north side of the Platte River valley west through Nebraska along the general path of the Oregon , Mormon and California Trails .   By December 1865 , the Union Pacific had only completed 40 miles ( 64 km ) of track , reaching Fremont , Nebraska , and a further 10 miles ( 16 km ) of roadbed .   At the end of 1865 , Peter A. Dey , Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific , resigned over a routing dispute with Thomas C. Durant , one of the chief financiers of the Union Pacific .   With the end of the Civil War and increased government supervision in the offing , Durant hired his former M&M engineer Grenville M. Dodge to build the railroad , and the Union Pacific began a mad dash west .   Former Union General John `` Jack '' Casement was hired as the new Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific . He equipped several railroad cars to serve as portable bunkhouses for the workers and gathered men and supplies to push the railroad rapidly west . Among the bunkhouses Casement added a galley car to prepare meals , and he even provided for a herd of cows to be moved with the railhead and bunk cars to provide fresh meat . Hunters were hired to provide buffalo meat from the large herds of American bison .   The small survey parties who scouted ahead to locate the roadbed were sometimes attacked and killed by raiding Native Americans . In response , the U.S. Army instituted active cavalry patrols that grew larger as the Native Americans grew more aggressive . Temporary , `` Hell on wheels '' towns , made mostly of canvas tents , accompanied the railroad as construction headed west .   The Platte River was too shallow and meandering to provide river transport , but the Platte river valley headed west and sloped up gradually at about 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) per 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) , often allowing to lay a mile ( 1.6 km ) of track a day or more in 1866 as the Union Pacific finally started moving rapidly west . Building bridges to cross creeks and rivers was the main source of delays . Near where the Platte River splits into the North Platte River and South Platte River , the railroad bridged the North Platte River over a 2,600 - foot - long ( 790 m ) bridge ( nicknamed 1⁄2 mile bridge ) . It was built across the shallow but wide North Platte resting on piles driven by steam pile drivers . Here they built the `` railroad '' town of North Platte , Nebraska in December 1866 after completing about 240 miles ( 390 km ) of track that year . In late 1866 , former Major General Grenville M. Dodge was appointed Chief Engineer on the Union Pacific , but hard working General `` Jack '' Casement continued to work as chief construction `` boss '' and his brother Daniel Casement continued as financial officer .   The original emigrant route across Wyoming of the Oregon , Mormon and California Trails , after progressing up the Platte River valley , went up the North Platte River valley through Casper , Wyoming , along the Sweetwater River and over the Continental Divide at 7,412 feet ( 2,259 m ) South Pass . The original westward travellers in their ox and mule pulled wagons tried to stick to river valleys to avoid as much road building as possible -- gradients and sharp corners were usually of little or no concern to them . The ox and mule pulled wagons were the original off - road vehicles in their day , since nearly all of the Emigrant Trails went cross country over rough , un-improved trails . The route over South Pass 's main advantage for wagons pulled by oxen or mules was a shorter elevation over an `` easy '' pass to cross and its `` easy '' connection to nearby river valleys on both sides of the continental divide for water and grass . The emigrant trails were closed in winter . The North Platte / South Pass route was far less beneficial for a railroad , as it was about 150 miles ( 240 km ) longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow , steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte . The route along the North Platte was also further from Denver , Colorado , and went across difficult terrain , while a railroad connection to that City was already being planned for and surveyed .   Efforts to survey a new , shorter , `` better '' route had been under way since 1864 . By 1867 , a new route was found and surveyed that went along part of the South Platte River in western Nebraska and after entering what is now the state of Wyoming , ascended a gradual sloping ridge between Lodgepole Creek and Crow Creek to 8,200 feet ( 2,500 m ) Evans pass ( also called Sherman 's Pass ) which was discovered by the Union Pacific employed English surveyor and engineer , James Evans , in about 1864 . This pass now is marked by the Ames Monument ( 41.131281 , - 105.398045 lat. , long . ) marking its significance and commemorating two of the main backers of the Union Pacific Railroad . From North Platte , Nebraska ( elevation 2,834 feet ( 864 m ) ) , the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the Nebraska Territory and Wyoming Territory ( then part of the Dakota Territory ) along the north bank of the South Platte River and into what would become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine , Wyoming . Evans Pass was located between what would become the new `` railroad '' towns of Cheyenne and Laramie . Connecting to this pass , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of Cheyenne , was the one place across the Laramie Mountains that had a narrow `` guitar neck '' of land that crossed the mountains without serious erosion at the so - called `` gangplank '' ( 41.099746 , - 105.153205 lat. , long . ) discovered by Major General Grenville Dodge in 1865 when he was in the U.S. Army . The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over 150 miles ( 240 km ) shorter , had a flatter profile , allowed for cheaper and easier railroad construction , and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the Wasatch and Laramie Ranges .   The railroad gained about 3,200 feet ( 980 m ) in the 220 miles ( 350 km ) climb to Cheyenne from North Platte , Nebraska -- about 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) per mile ( 1.6 km ) -- a very gentle slope of less than one degree average . This `` new '' route had never become an emigrant route because it lacked the water and grass to feed the emigrants ' oxen and mules . Steam locomotives did not need grass , and the railroad companies could drill wells for water if necessary .   Coal had been discovered in Wyoming and reported on by John C. Frémont in his 1843 expedition across Wyoming , and was already being exploited by Utah residents from towns like Coalville , Utah and later Kemmerer , Wyoming by the time the Transcontinental railroad was built . Union Pacific needed coal to fuel its steam locomotives on the almost treeless plains across Nebraska and Wyoming . Coal shipments by rail were also looked on as a potentially major source of income -- this potential is still being realized .   The Union Pacific reached the new railroad town of Cheyenne in December 1867 , having laid about 270 miles ( 430 km ) that year . They paused over the winter , preparing to push the track over Evans ( Sherman 's ) pass . At 8,247 feet ( 2,514 m ) , Evans / Sherman 's pass is the highest point reached on the transcontinental railroad . About 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) beyond Evans / Sherman 's pass , the railroad had to build an extensive bridge over the Dale Creek canyon ( 41.103803 , − 105.454797 , lat. , long . ) . The Dale Creek Crossing was one of their more difficult railroad engineering challenges . Dale Creek Bridge was 650 - foot ( 200 m ) long and 125 feet ( 38 m ) above Dale Creek . The bridge components were pre-built of timber in Chicago , Illinois and then shipped on rail cars to Dale Creek for assembly . The eastern and western approaches to the bridge site , near the highest elevation on the transcontinental railroad , required cutting through granite for nearly a mile on each side . The initial Dale Creek bridge had a train speed limit of 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) per hour across the bridge . Beyond Dale Creek , railroad construction paused at what became the town of Laramie , Wyoming to build a bridge across the Laramie River .   Located 35 miles ( 56 km ) from Evans pass , Union Pacific connected the new `` railroad '' town of Cheyenne to Denver and its Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company railroad line in 1870 . Elevated 6,070 feet ( 1,850 m ) above sea level , and sitting on the new Union Pacific route with a connection to Denver , Cheyenne was chosen to become a major railroad center and was equipped with extensive railroad yards , maintenance facilities and a Union Pacific presence . Its location made it a good base for helper locomotives to couple to trains with snowplows to help clear the tracks of snow or help haul heavy freight over Evans pass . The Union Pacific 's junction with the Denver Railroad with its connection to Kansas City , Kansas , Kansas City , Missouri and the railroads east of the Missouri River again increased Cheyenne 's importance as the junction of two major railroads . Cheyenne later became Wyoming 's largest city and the capital of the new state of Wyoming .   The railroad established many townships along the way : Fremont , Elkhorn , Grand Island , North Platte , Ogallala and Sidney as the railroad followed the Platte River across Nebraska territory . The railroad even dipped into what would become the new state of Colorado after crossing the North Platte River as it followed the South Platte River west into what would become Julesburg before turning northwest along Lodgepole Creek into Wyoming . In the Dakota Territory ( Wyoming ) the new towns of Cheyenne , Laramie , Rawlins ( named for Union General John Aaron Rawlins , who camped in the locality in 1867 . ) , Green River and Evanston ( named after James Evans ) were established , as well as many more fuel and water stops . The Green River was crossed with a new bridge , and the new `` railroad '' town of Green River constructed there after the tracks reached the Green River on October 1 , 1868 -- the last big river to cross .   On December 4 , 1868 , the Union Pacific reached Evanston , having laid almost 360 miles ( 580 km ) of track over the Green River and the Laramie Plains that year . By 1871 , Evanston became a significant maintenance shop town equipped to carry out extensive repairs on the cars and steam locomotives .   In the Utah Territory , the railroad once again diverted from the main emigrant trails to cross the Wasatch Mountains and went down the rugged Echo Canyon ( Summit County , Utah ) and Weber River canyon . To speed up construction as much as possible , Union Pacific contracted several thousand Mormon workers to cut , fill , trestle , bridge , blast and tunnel its way down the rugged Weber River Canyon to Ogden , Utah , ahead of the railroad construction . The Mormon and Union Pacific rail work was joined in the area of the present - day border between Utah and Wyoming . The longest of four tunnels built in Weber Canyon was 757 - foot - long ( 231 m ) Tunnel 2 . Work on this tunnel started in October 1868 and was completed six months later . Temporary tracks were laid around it and Tunnels 3 ( 508 feet ( 155 m ) ) , 4 ( 297 feet ( 91 m ) ) and 5 ( 579 feet ( 176 m ) ) to continue work on the tracks west of the tunnels .   The tunnels were all made with the new dangerous nitroglycerine explosive , which expedited work but caused some fatal accidents . While building the railroad along the rugged Weber River Canyon , Mormon workers signed the Thousand Mile Tree which was lone tree alongside the track 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) from Omaha . A historic marker has been placed there .   The tracks reached Ogden , Utah , on March 27 , 1869 , although finishing work would continue on the tracks , tunnels and bridges in Weber Canyon for over a year . From Ogden , the railroad went north of the Great Salt Lake to Brigham City and Corinne using Mormon workers , before finally connecting with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit in Utah territory on May 10 , 1869 . Some Union Pacific officers declined to pay the Mormons all of the agreed upon construction costs of the work through Weber Canyon , and beyond , claiming Union Pacific poverty despite the millions they had extracted through the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal . Only partial payment was secured through court actions against Union Pacific .   The Central Pacific laid 690 miles ( 1,110 km ) of track , starting in Sacramento , California , in 1863 and continuing over the rugged 7,000 - foot ( 2,100 m ) Sierra Nevada mountains at Donner Pass into the new state of Nevada . The elevation change from Sacramento ( elev. 40 ft or 12 m ) to Donner Summit ( elev . 7,000 ft or 2,100 m ) had to be accomplished in about 90 miles ( 140 km ) with an average elevation change of 76 feet per mile ( 14 meters per km ) , and there were only a few places in the Sierra where this type of `` ramp '' existed . The discovery and detailed map survey with profiles and elevations of this route over the Sierra Nevada is credited to Theodore Judah , chief engineer of the Central Pacific Railroad until his death in 1863 . This route is up a ridge between the North fork of the American River on the south and Bear River ( Feather River ) and South Yuba River on the north . As the railroad climbed out of Sacramento up to Donner Summit , there was only one 3 - mile ( 4.8 km ) section near `` Cape Horn CPRR '' where the railroad grade slightly exceeded two percent .   In June 1864 , the Central Pacific railroad entrepreneurs opened Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road ( DFDLWR ) . Costing about $300,000 and a years worth of work , this toll road wagon route was opened over much of the route the Central Pacific railroad ( CPRR ) would use over Donner Summit to carry freight and passengers needed by the CPRR and to carry other cargo over their toll road to and from the ever advancing railhead and over the Sierra to the gold and silver mining towns of Nevada . As the railroad advanced , their freight rates with the combined rail and wagon shipments would become much more competitive . The volume of the toll road freight traffic to Nevada was estimated to be about $13,000,000 a year as the Comstock Lode boomed , and getting even part of this freight traffic would help pay for the railroad construction . When the railroad reached Reno , it had the majority of all Nevada freight shipments , and the price of goods in Nevada dropped significantly as the freight charges to Nevada dropped significantly . The rail route over the Sierras followed the general route of the Truckee branch of the California Trail , going east over Donner Pass and down the rugged Truckee River valley .   The route over the Sierra had been plotted out by Judah in preliminary surveys before his death in 1863 . Judah 's deputy , Samuel S. Montague was appointed as Central Pacific 's new Chief Engineer , with Lewis M. Clement as Assistant Chief Engineer and Charles Cadwalader as second assistant . To build the new railroad , detailed surveys had to be run that showed where the cuts , fills , trestles , bridges and tunnels would have to be built . Work that was identified as taking a long time was started as soon as its projected track location could be ascertained and work crews , supplies and road work equipment found to be sent ahead . Tunnels , trestles and bridges were nearly all built this way . The spread - out nature of the work resulted in the work being split into two divisions , with L.M. Clement taking the upper division from Blue Cañon to Truckee and Cadwalader taking the lower division from Truckee to the Nevada border . Other assistant engineers were assigned to specific tasks such as building a bridge , tunnel or trestle which was done by the workers under experienced supervisors .   In total , the Central Pacific had eleven tunnel projects ( Nos. 3 through 13 ) under construction in the Sierra from 1865 -- 68 , with seven tunnels located in a 2 - mile ( 3.2 km ) stretch on the east side of Donner Summit . The tunnels were usually built by drilling a series of holes in the tunnel face , filling them with black powder and detonating it to break the rock free . The black powder was provided by the California Powder Works near Santa Cruz , California . These works had started production in 1864 after the U.S. Civil War had cut off shipments of black powder from the East to the mining and railroad industry of California and Nevada . The Central Pacific was a prolific user of black powder , often using up to 500 kegs of 25 pounds ( 11 kg ) each per day .   The summit tunnel ( Number 6 ) , 1,660 feet ( 510 m ) , was started in late 1865 , well ahead of the railhead . Through solid granite , the summit tunnel progressed at a rate of only about 0.98 feet ( 0.30 m ) per day per face as it was being worked by three eight - hour shifts of workers , hand drilling holes with a rock drill and hammer , filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose . One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion . The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865 -- 66 as there was no way to supply them , nor quarters they could have lived in . The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon .   In 1866 they put in a 125 - foot ( 38 m ) vertical shaft in the center of the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces , giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress . A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces . By the winter of 1866 -- 67 , work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue . The cross section of a tunnel face was a 16 - foot - wide ( 4.9 m ) , 16 - foot - high ( 4.9 m ) oval with an 11 - foot ( 3.4 m ) vertical wall . Progress on the tunnel sped up to over 1.5 feet ( 0.46 m ) per day per face when they started using the newly invented nitroglycerin -- manufactured near the tunnel . They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required 16 - foot ( 4.9 m ) height after the four tunnel faces met , and made even faster progress . Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle . Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated , they were left unlined or lined with brick , rock walls or timber and post . Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature . Despite this potential complication , nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) or so . The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required were nearly all done by the Canadian born and trained Lewis Clement , the CPRR 's Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track , and his assistants .   Hills or ridges in front of the railroad road bed would have to have a flat - bottomed , V shaped `` cut '' made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill . The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed . Ideally , these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade -- cut and fill construction . In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment that could be used to make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills . The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel , haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and / or horse or mule cart or blast it loose . To blast a V shaped cut out , they had to drill several holes up to 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) deep in the material , fill them with black powder , and blast \n","Name: document_text_clean, dtype:
